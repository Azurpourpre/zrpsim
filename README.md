# ZRPsim

This project is a PIO core emulator of the RP2040 chip.
This project is still very young, so it might crash, and a lot of features are still missing.

## TODOs

- [x]  Registers and FIFO
- [x]  State machine fetch, decode, execute instructions
- [x]  GPIO output
- [ ]  GPIO input
    + [ ]  Input from file
- [ ]  Interruptions
- [ ] Status Registers
- [ ] Autopush
- [ ] Wrapping

Maybe more ?
